On 12/16, I started a project called “mysite. ” I set it up as follows:
	1. I set up a virtual environment called venvs on the Desktop with the command: “virtualenv --python=python3.5 venvs”. See the directions for Virtual Environments in Notes.
	2. I activated the virtual environment with the command "source venvs/bin/activate" on the desktop.
	3. I then installed django with the commend ”pip install django”. It installed the latest version of django which was 1.10.4
	4. I issued the command: "django-admin startproject mysite" It set up a mysite folder on the Desktop with two things in it: manage.py, and a folder called mysite. In this other mysite folder were a settings.py file, a wdgi.py file, and a urls.py file (and an __init__py file too).
	5. I then went to the outer mysite directory and typed: python manage.py runserver. It returned: “You have 13 unapplied migration(s). Your project may not work properly until you apply the migrations for app(s): admin, auth, contenttypes, sessions.” No issues were detected. It said:  Run 'python manage.py migrate' to apply them.
	6. I did that. Again all was OK.
	7. I created a superuser by typing “python manage.py createsuperuser” It asked for my name. I used the default “williamsofer”, and an email address which I gave. I used the password “-------”. All went well.
	8. When I ran the server with the command “python manage.py runserver”, and added “admin” to 127.0.0. 1:8000/ in the browser, it asked me to log in and when I typed the username and password, the admin site showed up. Quit the runserver by typing control-C.
	9. In BBEdit, I opened a new project and called it “mysite Project”. I opened the mysite outer folder to include all the files in the folder in the project.
	10. I added five apps by typing "python manage.py startapp <name of app>" where the names of the apps were myintro, mycourses, myphotos, myblogs, and mybooks. 
	(BTW, I got an error message when I commented out something in a template that I hadn't yet referenced. It appears that regardless of whether something is commented, it is still recognized by django!).
	11. I included git by going to the folder enclosing the project and typing "git init". I then added all the files within the project by typing git add <filenames>. I downloaded the gitHub desktop, removed the djangogirls project and "published" the billsSite project. It showed up on github.com. However, the djangogirls project is still there, but I can select either the old one or the new.
	12. To deploy the new project on pythonanywhere (where I set up a paying account), I first clicked the delete button to deactivate the existing djangogirls project. This kept the project on the site, but didn't allow web access.
	13. After going to the billsofer directory, I cloned the billsSite project by typing: git clone https://github.com/billsofer/billsSite.git Typing :"tree billsSite", I saw a diagram of the site.
	14. I then created a new virtual environment at pythonanywhere in the billsSite directory by typing: "virtualenv --python=python3.5 venv" I then activated the virtual enviroment by typing "source venv/bin/activate"
	15. In the new venv, I installed django: "pip install django". It installed the latest version of django, 1.10.4. I also had to install Pillow with "pip install Pillow". 
	16. I migrated the models to the database using:"python manage.py migrate" I created a superuser account to use the admin site with: "python manage.py createsuperuser. Password is Jan14,41
	17. I had a problem adding photos to the pythonanywhere site. I haven't made use of the /static/ directory on the pythonanywhere web site. It apparently requires running "collectstatic" and changing the settings file. Instead, I used the admin site to add a photo. The file went to /home/billsSite. If you try to add another photo with the same name, a file gets added that has some gobblygook at the end. It also doesn't appear on the site! To correct this, delete all versions of the photo (use the file menu item on pythonanywhere) and add a new copy to the mysql database using the admin site (goes to /home/billsSite). Then upload a copy of the same file to the /home/billsSite/myphotos/static folder.Then delete the ones in the billsSite folder.
