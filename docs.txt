On 12/16, I started a project called “mysite. ” I set it up as follows:
	1. I set up a virtual environment called venvs on the Desktop with the command: “virtualenv --python=python3.5 venvs”. See the directions for Virtual Environments in Notes.
	2. I activated the virtual environment with the command "source venvs/bin/activate" on the desktop.
	3. I then installed django with the commend ”pip install django”. It installed the latest version of django which was 1.10.4
	4. I issued the command: "django-admin startproject mysite" It set up a mysite folder on the Desktop with two things in it: manage.py, and a folder called mysite. In this other mysite folder were a settings.py file, a wdgi.py file, and a urls.py file (and an __init__py file too).
	5. I then went to the outer mysite directory and typed: python manage.py runserver. It returned: “You have 13 unapplied migration(s). Your project may not work properly until you apply the migrations for app(s): admin, auth, contenttypes, sessions.” No issues were detected. It said:  Run 'python manage.py migrate' to apply them.
	6. I did that. Again all was OK.
	7. I created a superuser by typing “python manage.py createsuperuser” It asked for my name. I used the default “williamsofer”, and an email address which I gave. I used the password “-------”. All went well.
	8. When I ran the server with the command “python manage.py runserver”, and added “admin” to 127.0.0. 1:8000/ in the browser, it asked me to log in and when I typed the username and password, the admin site showed up. Quit the runserver by typing control-C.
	9. In BBEdit, I opened a new project and called it “mysite Project”. I opened the mysite outer folder to include all the files in the folder in the project.
	10. I added five apps by typing "python manage.py startapp <name of app>" where the names of the apps were myintro, mycourses, myphotos, myblogs, and mybooks. 
	(BTW, I got an error message when I commented out something in a template that I hadn't yet referenced. It appears that regardless of whether something is commented, it is still recognized by django!).
	11. I included git by going to the folder enclosing the project and typing "git init". I then added all the files within the project by typing git add <filenames>. I downloaded the gitHub desktop, removed the djangogirls project and "published" the billsSite project. It showed up on github.com.
